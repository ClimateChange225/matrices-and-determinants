# The Matrixinator
Calculates the sum, difference, product, transpose determinant, co-factor matrix, and adjoint of a matrix.

Hello, random person who decided to check this out.

I have a test for matrices and determinants in a day and usually use websites for cross-checking solutions.

While they all work great, the main problem I face is that I constantly have to use my mouse to click a cell for entering values.

While my code is not as good as theirs, it serves my purpose, which is to easily input matrices without having to constantly switch to my mouse.

If you find any bugs, please let me know. It is unlikely that I'll get to fixing them immediately, but I'm open to collaborating.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Again, it's pretty unlikely that I'll actually implement them, but I'd be happy to merge them after testing.


Thanks a lot for checking this out!
Have a great day :D
